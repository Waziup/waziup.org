WAZIHUB (in Swahili for Open-Hub) is an innovation project for Africa aiming to create an Open Hub of IoT and Big data cutting-edge and African-grade solutions, co-designed by African people where these solutions can then be adapted to match local service needs.

WAZIHUB brings experience to create a working environment to accelerate services based on collaborative knowledge generation and integration.
The project uses a collaborative problem-solving and innovation approach to enable win-win outcomes for both EU and African partners while tackling key societal challenges and problems.

The project aims to iterate and extract value from value-added IoT innovative services based on the technologies developed in WAZIUP (www.waziup.eu) and FiWARE (www.fiware.org). WAZIHUB exploits and shares IoT Technology best-practices through IoT regional ecosystems made up of innovation communities and stakeholders (e.g. entrepreneurs, startups, tech hubs, SMEs)
