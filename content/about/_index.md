WAZIHUB (in Swahili for Open-Hub) is an innovation project aiming to create an OpenHUB of IoT and Big data cutting-edge and African grade solutions. The vision of WAZIHUB is to exploit IoT potential and share IoT Technologies best-practices through the involvement of innovation communities and stakeholder. Our target stakeholders include DIY entrepreneurs, startups, developers, and innovation hubs across the African continent. 

The project aims to enable the creation of Open IoT Hubs throughout Africa where IoT technology solutions can then be adapted to match local service needs. The project iterates and extracts value by spining-off value-added IoT innovative services (e.g. monitoring, controlling, data analytic) based on the technologies developed in WAZIUP (www.waziup.eu project website) and FiWARE (www.fiware.org). 

WAZIUP is a technology-driven EU-Africa project developing a fully open source (waziup.eu) IoT end-to-end (sensors, networking and software) platform (www.waziup.io), specialized to meet African needs in terms of cost, energy, internet connectivity and simplicity.  The WAZIUP platform is developed using FIWARE Generic enablers. 

WAZIHUB's target is to support, at large-scale, innovative users and usage of the above mentioned technologies, with a goal towards the sustainability and wider-impact of the proposed solutions. WAZIHUB addresses 3 main issues:

 1. Making IoT technology more accessible in tech hubs and  innovation spaces in Africa
 2. Making the IoT start-up creation process easily replicable
 3. Making IoT business models more accessible and replicable
