The Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquées (ENSA) at Safi, Morocco and the IRD/UMMISCO at Yaoundé, Cameroon, have recently expressed great interest in the low-cost and open IoT approach promoted by the EU H2020 WAZIUP project.

The ENSA engineering school network is the top-ranked public engineering school in Morocco. At ENSA Safi,Prof. Congduc Pham (UPPA) presented to ENSA researchers the WAZIUP IoT platform that is currently deployed in a number of pilot sites in sub-Saharan Africa countries. 

Dr. Baraka Kemel from ENSA confirmed that Internet-of-Things (IoT) in various domains such as Agriculture and Surveillance is receiving highest attention from local authorities and industries (such as OCP which is one of the world’s largest phosphate producers – Prof. Pham had the opportunity to visit the OCP industrial site in Safi) and that the WAZIUP approach can definitely be tested and deployed in a number of local use cases.

To show the maturity of the WAZIUP solution, Prof. Pham brought a WAZIUP IoT starter kit that has been installed in a few minutes, sending every hour the ambiant air temperature and humidity level to the WAZIUP IoT platform. Since the WAZIUP IoT approach has been designed from the beginning for maximum appropriation and customization by third-parties, it is expected that ENSA IoT research team will start building their own WAZIUP IoT devices and gateways to set up an Agriculture pilot test with the support of the numerous tutorial materials provided by WAZIUP.
