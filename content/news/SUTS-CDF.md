At	Swinburne	Sarawak,	in	addition	to	presenting	the	WAZIUP	technology	to	CDF's	researchers,	a	workshop	on	the	applications	of	Internet	of	Things	(IoT)	for	government	officials	was	organized	on	7	February	2018	by	Director	of	CDF,	Prof.

Patrick	Then.	“In	this	workshop,	we	will	engage	with	various	government	agencies	so	we	can	share	our	expertise	and	gather	feedback	from	them particularly	to	understand	the	challenges	they	face	in	smart	farming	and	smart	cities,	and	ultimately	providing	them	with	a	framework	for	solution	development	to	support	the	state’s	Digital	Economy	vision,”	said	Prof.	Then.	

More	than	50	people	attended	the	workshop	and	the	final	question & answer	panel		showed	the	increasing	interest	of	government	agencies	in	IoT	related	technologies.	

It	is	foreseen	that	a	number	of	IoT-related	projects	will	be	funded	by	local	agencies	where	the	WAZIUP	approach	can	be	tested	and	
deployed.	Again,	it	is	expected	that	CDF	research	teams	will	start	building	their	own	WAZIUP	IoT	devices	and	gateways	with	the	support	of	the	numerous	tutorial	materials	provided	by	WAZIUP.
