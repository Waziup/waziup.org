The IRD (Institut de recherche pour le développement) is a French research organism that emphasizes on interdisciplinarity research. The IRD has focused its research for over 65 years on the relationship between man and its environment, in Africa, Mediterranean, Latin America, Asia and the French tropical overseas territories. UMMISCO is the IRD's international laboratory on complex system modelling.

At IRD/UMMISCO–Yaoundé, Prof. Pham (UPPA) first presented the recent long-range radio technologies that make IoT deployment much simpler. Prof. Pham reviewed the main characteristics of these new radio technologies, explained how they dramatically change IoT deployment scenarios and presented the various building blocks of the new emerging IoT ecosystem. This technical presentation mainly targeted UMMISCO and University Yaoundé researchers already working in the Wireless Sensor Networks domain and researchers from IRD working on environmental monitoring.

In a second talk, Prof. Pham presented to a wider audience a more didactic presentation to introduce the main technologies that constitute the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem, focusing especially on how to make the IoT revolution available to the largest number of people. Prof. Pham showed how an IoT "do-it-yourself" approach, made possible by the convergence and the maturity of a number of technologies, can allow for low-cost yet efficient IoT deployment scenarios. Illustrations are given with several use cases and hardware prototypes from the WAZIUP project to show the provided hardware/software building blocks for low-cost IoT in developping countries and technology transfer initiatives to foster entrepreneurship on IoT for local economy.

Both Dr Serge Stinckwitch from UMMISCO and Dr Jean-Jacques BRAUN, director of IRD– Cameroon, confirmed that IoT can bring interesting features for environmental surveillance networks in a number of IRD's projects. It is expected that research teams will start building their own WAZIUP IoT devices and gateways with the support of the numerous tutorial materials provided by WAZIUP.
