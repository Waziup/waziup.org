The poster was held in the European Project Space and received positives feedback from experts considering the global architecture was pertinent. 

Visitors were impressed by the wealth of the content, as well as the project scale, from the sensors to the application. After the conference, Charlotte and Sabrine were invited to write a book chapter on WAZIUP project, that will be published by ScitePress.
