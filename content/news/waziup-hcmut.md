The	IoT	Lab	at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT, Ho Chi Minh	City, Vietnam) and the	Centre	for	Digital	Futures	(CDF) at Swinburne University	of	Technology	Sarawak	Campus	(SUTS,	Kuching, Malaysia) have	recently expressed	great	interest in	the	low-cost and open IoT approach promoted by	the	EU	H2020 WAZIUP project.

At	HCMUT,	Philippe	Cousin	(EGM)	and	Congduc	Pham	(UPPA)	presented	to	Dean	of		Computer	Science	Department	(Prof.	Nam	Thoai),	Director	of	the	IoT	Lab	(Dr.	Hoang	Anh	Pham)		and	IoT	Lab	researchers	the	WAZIUP	IoT	platform	that	is	currently	deployed	in	a	number	of	pilot	sites	in	sub-Saharan	Africa	countries. 

Both	Prof.	Thoai	and	Dr	Pham	from	HCMUT	confirmed	that	IoT	in	various	domains	such	as	SmartCities	and	Aquaculture	are	receiving	highest	
attention	from	local	authorities	and	that	the	WAZIUP	approach	can	definitely	be	tested	and	deployed	in	a	number	of	local	use	cases.	To	show	the	maturity	of	the	WAZIUP	solution,	Prof.	Pham	from	UPPA	brought	a	WAZIUP	IoT	starter	kit	that was	installed	in	a	few	minutes,sending	every	hour	the	ambiant	temperature	to	the	WAZIUP	IoT	platform.

Since	the	WAZIUP	IoT	approach	has	been	designed	from	the	beginning	for	maximum	appropriation	and	customization	by	third-parties,	it	is	expected	that	HCMUT	research	teams	will	start	building	their	own	WAZIUP	IoT	devices	and	gateways	with	the	support	of	the	numerous	tutorial	materials provided	by	WAZIUP.
