One of several WAZIHUB IoT Bootcamps dubbed “Wazihub IoT Weekend” was held on Saturday 23rd July 2018 in Kumasi, Ghana. 


<!--more-->
During this event participants were briefed on how IoT can be used as a tool to combat some social issues and automate certain processes to increase living standards. Participants were shown how Waziup made rapid prototyping and IoT big data analytics easy and efficient by taking them through a practical making session in which they developed solutions using Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers to post sensor data to the Waziup platform. The above set of activities peeked their interest and lead to their registration and participation in the five-day boot camp together with new members from 27th – 31st July 2018.

#### Day One
The Bootcamp started from 27th July through to 31st July 2018 at Kumasi Hive with over 40 participants. This training session was very intensive with the support of both WAZIUP and WAZIHUB consortium.
In the first day’s session, an overview of IOT was presented to participants by Fiifi Baidoo (Co-Founder, iSpace) for them to understand where IoT is going and some of the amazing things they can use IOT to build and solve certain problems.  They were also taken through Use Cases within which IOT can be built. These included, Crop farming, Cattle Farm, Waste Management, Fish farming and many more. Dr. Abdur (WAZIUP/WAZIHUB project Lead) opened intro to the IoT Workshop by presenting a scholarly Keynote Address to participants.

Session two of Day one focused on Enlightenment of IOT. This was led by Corentin, and the entire team of Kumasi Hive. Participants were taken through the overview of WAZIUP toolkits and materials and focused on areas within which IOT can be used to solve existing problems. To make this exercise effective, all the participants were grouped according to focused areas, such as Agriculture, Health and Commerce/Financial. The first day’s session ended with the introduction of Design Thinking to participants.

#### Day Two
The second day was packed with series of activities. All the groups were tasked to go for a field trip to meet stakeholders and identify the challenges or problems they are facing in their sectors/areas of operations.  The various groups were given the opportunity to present the problems they identified from stakeholders and were asked to generate a product idea to solve those challenges within the Design Thinking context using IoT. This session was led by Jorge Appiah (Co-Founder of Kumasi Hive), Dr. Corentin, Babacar and Aziz. Later in the second day, the groups were led through IoT Sensor Node prototyping session, where each group presented prototypes that will resolve the problems identified.

#### Day Three
Training Day three was very interesting because all the groups were practically involved in WAZIUP IoT Cloud visualization and Application Development. These involved, IoT Cloud Basics, Data visualization with Kibana, smart web applications development and Mobile applications development tools. These were led by Dr. Corentin Dupont and Prince Banini. Participants were finally guided through IoT Sensors Connectivity and Communications.

#### Day Four
Day Four marked the day where all groups were given the opportunity to continue working on their prototypes for the Hackathon. Some of the groups stayed in the night to complete the final development of their Minimum Viable Products using different applications.

#### Day Five
On the final day of the Boot camp, participants were allowed some hours to finalize their projects. They were also taking through how to give a pitch and prepare their presentation slides (Pitch Deck). The second part of the final day took the participants through the pitch session. 7 groups show-cased their Minimum Viable Products (MVP) and pitched their business. The groups included, JEST, GPL, EASY, FOCUS,BOSU, RHEEDA and HER. 

The JEST Group identified a specific problem in the health sector and their prototype was designed to resolve the problem. They developed and presented a Smart Wrist Band from Internet of Things (IoT) to help patients and healthcare providers track and monitor patients’ records.
GPL group visited some farms during the field visit exercise to have dialogue with some farmers. The group gathered some information about challenges the farmers are going through. From the data gathered, the group developed and presented an IoT built pest control system that will help farmers to control pest effectively.

The Easy group built their project on waste management. It is very important to keep our cities and markets clean and wholesome for our living. They took this preamble into consideration, they were able to build and present a Smart Waste bin that would help us to keep the environment Clean. The bin has a sensor that opens the lid or cover when a user gets close to it. The sensor also alerts the waste management company when the bin is full.

The FOCUS group were more concerned about the disabled, especially the visually impaired. The group found that most people within this calibre faced a lot challenges moving from one place to the other. The Focus group developed a solution by building a Smart Wearable device to help the visually impaired navigate easily.

The BOSU group were also not left out. They made their feasibility study to identify problems our supermarkets and hypermarkets are facing in the country. They realized that most of these shops could not monitor and control their inventory very well.  Due to this problem, the group developed a Smart Shelve device to monitor inventory and security in these shops.

Farmers in the Agricultural sector faced a lot of challenges after harvesting period. They found it difficult to store all their produce and prevent them deteriorating. Group HER identified this problem and decided to develop a solution using an IoT device. The group was able to develop a Smart Fridge to help farmers overcome post harvest losses.

The last Team named RHEEDA developed and demonstrated a smart Temperature Control System for Laboratory use. This IoT technology will  provide scalable solutions for the precise temperatures in the lab.
