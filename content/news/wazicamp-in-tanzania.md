In an era where technology has been incorporated into every aspect of our lives, Waziup once again organized a four day IoT training session from the 8th to 11th October, 2018. 

<!--more-->
The Waziup IoT Bootcamp was held at Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania in partnership with Buni Innovation Hub and it was aimed at tech developers, entrepreneurs and students. There was a total of 37 participants who registered for the event. This boot camp informed and instructed participants on how to design and deploy end to end IOT sensor solutions using the Wazihub platform for applications in Africa.

**DAY ONE**

The event kicked off with a general introduction session. It involved the registration of the participants and general welcome address to open the whole boot camp event. There was also an Opening IoT workshop that threw light on what IoT is and its related devices. Several use cases were presented to give a more solid appreciation of the use of IoT. During the second session for the day, an overview of Waziup toolkits and materials, team formation and focus areas led by Corentin were discussed. Fiifi and personnel from Buni led a pitch presentation that helped equip the participants on how to give a pitch and then the participants presented their ideas.

**DAY TWO**

Day two started with a session on IoT sensor node prototyping which was led by Prince. As part of this session, there was an introduction on Raspberry Pi and Arduino, both of which are IoT hardware. It was followed by a presentation on prototyping sensors node based on Arduino after a short break. The second session of the day delved into IoT connectivity. This included the introduction to IoT LoRa framework and prototyping sensors node with LoRa.

**DAY THREE**

Boot camp started the third day with lessons on Waziup IoT cloud visualization which included the Waziup dashboard smart web applications development and Mobile application development tools. The participants were also taken through application prototyping and data visualization and were given a hands-on training on the former. All the activities for the day was led by Dr. Corentin Dupont.

**DAY FOUR**

The final day was climaxed with the participants completing their projects which included fine tuning their presentations for showcase. These activities were led by Fiifi and Bani.
