"	Senegal, post and telecommunications ministry
"	Nigeria, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)
"	Republic of Congo, communication ministry
"	Guinea-Bissau, communication ministry
"	Republic of Guinea, communication ministry

These visitors were impressed by the Waziup project and have expressed their interest in hosting the same training in their respective countries.

The talks with the government representatives are ongoing in order to find solutions for quick and effective adoption of IoT solutions in Africa. This involves setting up IoT training sessions in African universities and organizing IoT Hackatons in order to awaken dormant talent in the IoT domain.

The economic benefits of implementing IoT is seen as a cutting edge advantage in its adoption and  much interest was expressed in the adoption of IoT as it is seen as the next big revolution.
