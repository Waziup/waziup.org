IoT Clubs are original initiative to tackle the process of spreading IoT in Africa.  They are based  on  the FabLabs networks to localize the european project WAZIUP. Then  the clubs become the lieu  for sensibilisation and experimentation on the issues and potential of IoT.

The #IoTClubs appear as a relay  for Waziup, preparatory to its next moves. #IoTClubs put ressources, infrastructures and WAZIUP platform as a priority in their effort to vulgarize IoT. 
As part  of this program, two FabLabs in Africa proceeded  organizing events : WOELAB based in Cotonou (Bénin) and  BabyLab based in Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire).
